There are several issues with the project as is:

1. The socketserver utilized isn't robust and optimization with docker can be problematic
2. There is no database integration within the server. As a result user data as well as recipes are
   stored as dictionaries in lists rather than in a database. This was a design choice born out of 2
   considerations. The first being the time needed to finish a working project. The second being that
   I was not sure how to go about integrating postgres into this. My familiarity is with using frameworks
   such as Django and Flask which has databases integrated already into the code. I could not figure out a 
   way to do the same. Despite the time constraints, I still made a passing effort but could not make it
   work.
3. For authentication I used Basic Auth. This is not robust at all and should have used OAuth2.0 in
   the least. It was a time consideration but as an implementation issue. The docker build does however
   automatically create an self signed certificate to enable to run as an HTTPS server. I've disabled
   the HTTPS function since the certificate is self signed it raises errors in Chrome. The functionality
   is however present.
